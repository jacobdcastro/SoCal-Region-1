            <p class="bio">In 2006, Pastor John C. Martin moved to Victorville, California from Seattle, Washington to pastor Victorville First Assembly. In the almost 12 years that Pastor John has been pastoring at Victorville First Assembly, the church has expanded from one to ten campus locations. In addition, the church offers worship services in English, Spanish, Korean, Indonesian and American Sign Language. The church's ministries have more than doubled in number and currently include the Feed My Sheep Food Bank, a School of Ministry, and Victor Valley Christian School. Pastor John has a heart to reach people for Christ and to develop fully devoted followers of God! As witnessed in the growth and expansion of the ministries underneath his leadership, he knows he serves a Big God who is capable of more than we could think or imagine, and he chases after all that God has at full speed.</p>
