            <p>In 2006, Pastor John C. Martin moved to Victorville, California from Seattle, Washington to pastor Victorville First Assembly. In the almost 12 years that Pastor John has been pastoring at Victorville First Assembly, the church has expanded from one to ten campus locations. In addition, the church offers worship services in English, Spanish, Korean, Indonesian and American Sign Language. The church's ministries have more than doubled in number and currently include the Feed My Sheep Food Bank, a School of Ministry, and Victor Valley Christian School. Pastor John has a heart to reach people for Christ and to develop fully devoted followers of God! As witnessed in the growth and expansion of the ministries underneath his leadership, he knows he serves a Big God who is capable of more than we could think or imagine, and he chases after all that God has at full speed.</p>

            For classical Pentecostals, the manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit in a public worship environment is a mark of authenticity - but seems to be dwindling in frequency and relevance. This workshop will focus on ways of engaging and empowering Next-Gen pentecostals in the use of the Gifts of the Spirit in a way that builds up the Body of Christ.

            We've all been there, the worship experience in a large room at mega churches or conferences is incredible. The band, the worship leader, the prop audio, lights, and production leave you feeling inspired to come back to your smaller church setting with fresh vigor. And then the harsh reality of limitation sets in again. "The space can't handle the stage volume." "We don't have a drummer that can play like that." "What about backing tracks?" "Where do I even begin?" We have all asked these questions. But, perhaps there's MORE that we can do for our small church worship setting by actually DOING LESS. Come find out!
